# Security Core

These rules apply to every change, in every language. They are never optional.

- **No secrets or personal data in logs.** Never log tokens, passwords, keys, fødselsnummer (FNR), name or address.
- **Secrets come from the environment.** Read tokens, passwords and keys from environment variables or the secret store. Never hardcode them.
- **Parameterized queries only.** Never concatenate user input into SQL or shell commands. Validate input at trust boundaries.
- **Verify resource ownership.** Check that the caller owns the resource, not only that the caller is authenticated.
- **Validate `azp` for machine-to-machine calls** against `AZURE_APP_PRE_AUTHORIZED_APPS`.
- **TLS 1.2 or newer.** Never set `InsecureSkipVerify: true` or disable certificate validation.
